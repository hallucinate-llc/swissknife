# SwissKnife Test System Diagnostic Report

## Summary
After comprehensive testing of the SwissKnife test environment, we've identified several issues that prevent tests from running correctly. This document outlines our findings and provides recommendations for fixing these issues.

## Core Issues

### 1. Module Format Compatibility Issues
The project uses ESM modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json) but many of the tests are written with CommonJS imports/exports or a mix of both formats. This creates compatibility issues.

### 2. Jest Configuration Issues
- Jest is configured for CommonJS by default but needs special handling for ESM modules
- Multiple Jest configurations exist with conflicting settings
- The Jest Haste module system reports naming collisions from duplicate files

### 3. Test Environment Setup
- There are inconsistencies between the test setup files
- Chai and Jest expect assertions are mixed across test files
- TypeScript configuration for tests may not be properly aligned with ESM modules

### 4. Mocking Issues
- Mocks are defined inconsistently across test files
- ESM modules require different mocking strategies than CommonJS modules

## Test Status

### Working Tests
- Basic sanity tests work in isolation
- Minimal tests work when properly configured

### Tests Requiring Fixes
- `test/unit/models/registry.test.ts`: Has import compatibility issues
- `test/unit/storage/storage.test.ts`: Has import and mock definition issues
- `test/unit/commands/help-generator.test.ts`: Has TypeScript compilation and mock issues

## Recommendations

### Short-term Fixes
1. **Use a consistent module format** - Either convert all tests to ESM (recommended) or use CommonJS for testing
2. **Standardize Jest configuration** - Use a single Jest configuration that properly handles ESM modules
3. **Fix import statements** - Ensure all imports include file extensions (.js) for ESM compatibility
4. **Update mocks** - Convert mocks to use the ESM module format

### Example Fix for ESM Compatibility
For all TypeScript files, ensure imports include the `.js` extension even when importing `.ts` files:

```typescript
// Change this:
import { ModelRegistry } from '../../../src/ai/models/registry';

// To this:
import { ModelRegistry } from '../../../src/ai/models/registry.js';
```

### Comprehensive Mocking Fix
Create a shared mock setup file for common dependencies:

```javascript
// test/mocks/common-mocks.js
export const setupCommonMocks = () => {
  // Example mocking CommandRegistry
  jest.mock('../src/commands/registry.js', () => ({
    CommandRegistry: {
      getInstance: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
        getCommand: jest.fn(),
        getAllCommands: jest.fn(),
        getCommandsByCategory: jest.fn(),
        getCategories: jest.fn()
      })
    }
  }));
};
```

### Long-term Fixes
1. **Document testing practices** - Create a testing guide for the project
2. **Create test templates** - Provide sample test files that work correctly
3. **Set up CI/CD validation** - Ensure tests pass on each commit
4. **Refactor test infrastructure** - Consider using Vitest which has better ESM support

## Test Results
Multiple test runs were performed with various configurations. The most consistent issues were:
- Module naming collisions in the Haste system
- Issues with ESM/CommonJS module interoperability
- Mock compatibility issues with ESM
- TypeScript path aliasing not working correctly in test environment

## Conclusion
The testing environment requires standardization and proper configuration for the ESM module format. We recommend starting with the simplest tests, ensuring they pass, and then progressively addressing more complex test cases.
