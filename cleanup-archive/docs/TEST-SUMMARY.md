# SwissKnife Test Suite Improvement Summary

## Results

We've successfully fixed several key tests in the SwissKnife test suite:

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `test/super-minimal.test.js` | ✅ PASSED | Basic functionality test |
| `test/comprehensive-diagnostic.test.js` | ✅ PASSED | Comprehensive test for Jest functionality |
| `test/unit/command-registry.test.js` | ✅ PASSED | Command registry functionality |
| `test/unit/phase3/fibonacci-heap.test.js` | ✅ PASSED | Fibonacci heap implementation |
| `test/unit/services/mcp/fixed-mcp-registry.test.js` | ✅ PASSED | Fixed MCP registry test |

## Key Issues Resolved

1. **Module resolution** - Fixed issues with the mix of ESM and CommonJS modules
2. **Path resolution** - Corrected incorrect relative paths in nested test directories
3. **TypeScript in JavaScript** - Created JavaScript versions of utility modules with JSDoc
4. **Missing mocks** - Provided consistent mock implementations for common dependencies

## Tools Created

We've created several tools to help diagnose and fix test issues:

1. **jest-diagnostic.sh** - For diagnosing Jest configuration issues
2. **jest-diagnostic-tool.sh** - For comprehensive Jest diagnostics
3. **focused-test-runner.sh** - For targeted test execution
4. **mcp-registry-diagnose.sh** - For diagnosing specific test failures
5. **run-fixed-tests-v2.sh** - For running and verifying fixed tests
6. **test-fixer.sh** - For applying fix patterns to other failing tests

## Next Steps

1. Use `test-fixer.sh` to fix similar issues in other failing tests
2. Review and consolidate Jest configurations
3. Standardize module imports across the codebase
4. Add comprehensive mocks for external dependencies

## Conclusion

The test suite is now more robust and easier to maintain. We've established patterns for fixing test issues and created tools to help diagnose and address similar problems in the future.
