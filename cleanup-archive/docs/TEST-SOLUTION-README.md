# SwissKnife Test Solution

A comprehensive solution for running all tests in the SwissKnife project.

## Overview

This test solution includes specialized runners for different types of tests:

1. **Master Test Runner** (`master-test-runner.sh`): Runs JavaScript tests with proper configuration
2. **TypeScript Test Runner** (`typescript-test-runner.sh`): Focuses on TypeScript tests
3. **Worker Test Runner** (`worker-test-runner.sh`): Specifically for worker thread tests
4. **Complete Test Runner** (`complete-test-runner.sh`): Runs all tests in sequence with detailed reporting

## Quick Start

To run all tests and get a comprehensive report:

```bash
./complete-test-runner.sh
```

This will run all test categories in sequence and produce a detailed report.

## Running Specific Test Categories

### For JavaScript Tests Only

```bash
./master-test-runner.sh
```

### For TypeScript Tests Only

```bash
./typescript-test-runner.sh
```

### For Worker Tests Only

```bash
./worker-test-runner.sh
```

## Test Report

After running the tests, you'll find a detailed report in:

```
complete-tests-<timestamp>/reports/test-summary.md
```

The report includes the status of each test category and any failures.

## Fixing Failed Tests

If specific tests fail, you can:

1. Check the logs in the corresponding results directory
2. Fix any issues in the source code or mocks
3. Run the specific test category again to verify your fix

## Test Configurations

The solution uses several Jest configurations:

- `jest.master.config.cjs`: Main configuration for JavaScript tests
- `jest.typescript.config.cjs`: Configuration for TypeScript tests
- `jest.workers.config.cjs`: Special configuration for worker tests

## Mock Implementations

The solution includes mock implementations for common dependencies:

- Event Bus system
- Error handling system
- Worker thread system
- Configuration system

These mocks allow the tests to run without actual dependencies.

## Additional Notes

- All test results are saved with timestamps for easy tracking
- Each run creates a new directory for its results
- Test logs are saved for debugging failed tests
- The solution handles both CommonJS and ES Modules
