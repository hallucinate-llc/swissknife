# SwissKnife Test Fixing Session Report

## Summary of Fixes

During this session, we successfully fixed the following test issues:

1. **FibonacciHeap Test**:
   - Corrected the import path from `../..js` to the proper absolute path
   - Fixed the export of `FibHeapNode` at the module level
   - Ensured TypeScript compatibility with proper exports

2. **ModelSelector Test**:
   - Created a comprehensive mock implementation for Ink components
   - Enhanced React hook mocking to better handle state management
   - Improved handling of component tests with proper cleanup

## Key Implementation Details

### FibonacciHeap Fix

The primary issue with the FibonacciHeap test was related to module exports and imports. We fixed it by:

1. Properly exporting the `FibHeapNode` at the top level of the module:
   ```javascript
   // Added at the top of the module
   export { createNode as FibHeapNode };
   ```

2. Correcting the import path in the test file:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   import { FibonacciHeap, FibHeapNode } from '../.js';
   
   // To:
   import { FibonacciHeap, FibHeapNode } from '../../../src/tasks/scheduler/fibonacci-heap.js';
   ```

3. Ensuring assertion compatibility by standardizing on Jest-style assertions.

### React/Ink Component Testing

For the ModelSelector test, we created a dedicated mock implementation for Ink components:

```javascript
// test/mocks/stubs/ink-mock.js
const Box = jest.fn(({ children }) => {
  return children || null;
});

const Text = jest.fn(({ children }) => {
  return children || '';
});

const useInput = jest.fn((callback) => {
  // Simulate key presses
  setTimeout(() => callback('', { return: true }), 10);
  return () => {}; // unsubscribe function
});

// ... other components and exports
```

This approach provides a more flexible and maintainable way to test React components that use Ink.

## New Scripts Created

1. **`fix-fibonacci-heap-test.sh`**: Specifically targets the FibonacciHeap test issues
2. **`fix-model-selector-test-extended.sh`**: Comprehensive fix for ModelSelector test
3. **`comprehensive-test-runner-final.sh`**: Final version of the test runner with detailed reporting
4. **`test-individual-fixes.sh`**: Test script for validating individual fixes

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Standardize Import Paths**: Use absolute paths for imports in test files for clarity and maintainability
2. **Extract Common Mock Implementations**: Keep creating reusable mock implementations for third-party libraries
3. **Maintain Consistent Assertion Style**: Standardize on either Jest or Chai assertion style across tests
4. **Regular Test Validation**: Run the comprehensive test suite regularly to catch regressions early

## Conclusion

The fixes implemented in this session address core issues with the test suite, particularly around module resolution and component testing. By properly exporting module functions and creating robust mock implementations, we've established a more stable testing foundation for the SwissKnife project.

These improvements will make it easier to maintain existing tests and add new ones as the project evolves.
