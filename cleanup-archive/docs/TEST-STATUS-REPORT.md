## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test import issues with multiple .js extensions
2. Complete tests for configuration manager
3. Implement model selector and registry tests
4. Complete MCP client and server tests

## Challenges
- Many modules have corrupted imports with multiple .js extensions ✅ Fixed in key modules
- Inconsistent module systems (CommonJS vs ESM) ✅ Working solution with proper Jest config
- Need to standardize test patterns across the codebase ✅ Implementing consistent approach

## Solutions Applied
1. Created a proper Chai stub for Jest compatibility
2. Fixed module imports with multiple .js extensions
3. Standardized on CommonJS for test files (better Jest compatibility)
4. Improved Jest configuration to handle mixed module formats
