# Goose Integration Plan for SwissKnife

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating Goose features into the SwissKnife system. We will borrow all features from Goose, but use a clean room reimplementation approach to recreate them in TypeScript rather than Rust. This approach ensures we maintain complete independence from the original Rust codebase while aligning with the SwissKnife technology stack and enabling tighter coupling with the system.

For details on our clean room reimplementation strategy, see [CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./docs/CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Key Requirements

1. **Clean Room TypeScript Implementation**
   - Implement all Goose features as independent TypeScript modules
   - Follow clean room development methodology without direct code translation
   - Maintain feature parity while adapting to the TypeScript ecosystem
   - Optimize for performance within the TypeScript runtime environment

2. **Tight Coupling with SwissKnife**
   - Integrate all features directly into the SwissKnife codebase
   - Create unified interfaces across components
   - Enable seamless communication between modules

3. **IPFS Kit MCP Server Integration**
   - Use the IPFS Kit MCP server as the primary storage/memory medium
   - Maintain loose coupling specifically for this component
   - Implement proper interfaces for communication

4. **Enhanced Task Decomposition**
   - Implement tasknet enhancements for improved workflow
   - Create sophisticated task delegation systems
   - Support dynamic problem decomposition
   - Utilize decentralized peer-based task distribution via libp2p pubsub

## Core Architecture

The integration will follow a Model-Controller-Persistence (MCP) pattern as outlined in the IPFS Kit documentation, with the following components:

### 1. Model Layer

The Model layer will contain all the business logic and domain-specific functionality:

- **AI Agent Models**: Core Goose AI capabilities rewritten in TypeScript
- **Task Management Models**: Enhanced TaskNet functionality for decomposing complex problems
- **Tool Interface Models**: TypeScript implementations of Goose tool definitions and interfaces

The Model layer will be tightly coupled with the SwissKnife system, enabling direct integration with existing functionality.

### 2. Controller Layer

The Controller layer will handle request processing and orchestration:

- **Command Controllers**: Handle CLI commands and user interactions
- **Graph-of-Thought Controllers**: Implement advanced reasoning patterns based on tasknet enhancements
- **Tool Execution Controllers**: Manage the execution of tools and process results

Controllers will be designed to work directly with the SwissKnife codebase, providing seamless integration.

### 3. Persistence Layer (IPFS Kit)

The Persistence layer will leverage the IPFS Kit MCP server:

- **IPFS Storage**: Content-addressable storage for all data
- **IPLD Integration**: Graph-based knowledge representation
- **Tiered Caching**: Multi-level caching system for improved performance

This layer will maintain a looser coupling via well-defined interfaces, allowing the IPFS Kit MCP server to operate independently while still integrating with the SwissKnife system.

## Technical Details

### TypeScript Implementation

The TypeScript implementation will focus on these key aspects:

```typescript
// Example AI Agent interface
interface AIAgent {
  processMessage(message: string, context: AgentContext): Promise<AgentResponse>;
  executeAction(action: AgentAction): Promise<ActionResult>;
  registerTool(tool: Tool): void;
  getTools(): Tool[];
}

// Example Tool interface
interface Tool {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: ToolParameter[];
  execute(params: any, context: ToolContext): Promise<ToolResult>;
}

// Example Graph-of-Thought node
interface GoTNode {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  type: ThoughtNodeType;
  dependencies: string[];
  priority: number;
  status: NodeStatus;
  result?: any;
}

// Example IPFS Kit client interface
interface IPFSKitClient {
  addContent(content: string | Buffer): Promise<{ cid: string }>;
  getContent(cid: string): Promise<Buffer>;
  createCar(roots: string[], blocks?: Record<string, Buffer>): Promise<{ carCid: string }>;
  addToKnowledgeGraph(entity: Entity, relationships: Relationship[]): Promise<void>;
}
```

### IPFS Kit MCP Server Integration

Integration with the IPFS Kit MCP server will be implemented via:

1. **REST API Client**
   - Access IPFS Kit via well-defined REST endpoints
   - Handle authentication and error states
   - Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations

2. **CLI-Optimized Communication Layer**
   - Implement real-time updates for model inference data
   - Support streaming of large neural network datasets
   - Enable efficient data exchange for AI inference tasks

3. **IPLD Graph Operations**
   - Create, update, and query IPLD structures
   - Build and manipulate DAG representations
   - Implement content-addressed memory operations

### Decentralized Task Distribution System

Implementing the libp2p pubsub-based task distribution system:

1. **Merkle Clock Task Assignment**
   - Use Merkle clocks to establish consistent temporal ordering across the network
   - Enable deterministic task assignment without central coordination
   - Implement efficient synchronization of clock states between peers

2. **Hamming Distance Peer Selection**
   ```typescript
   interface PeerSelectionSystem {
     // Calculate Hamming distance between peer ID and clock head
     calculateHammingDistance(peerId: string, clockHead: string): number;
     
     // Determine if the current peer should process the task
     isResponsibleForTask(task: Task, peers: Peer[]): boolean;
     
     // Normalize peer IDs and clock heads for comparison
     normalizeForComparison(value: string): string;
     
     // Get the currently responsible peer for a given task
     getResponsiblePeer(task: Task, peers: Peer[]): Peer;
   }
   ```
   - Hash both peer IDs and clock heads to ensure equal length for accurate distance calculation
   - Select the peer with minimal Hamming distance to process tasks from queue
   - Implement batch processing limits to prevent task monopolization

3. **Reputation-Based Queue Management**
   ```typescript
   interface PeerReputationSystem {
     // Update peer reputation based on task completion
     updateReputation(peerId: string, success: boolean): void;
     
     // Check if a peer is considered "lazy" based on reputation
     isPeerLazy(peerId: string): boolean;
     
     // Get current reputation score for a peer
     getReputationScore(peerId: string): number;
     
     // Rerank the task queue based on peer reputation
     reorderTaskQueue(queue: Task[]): Task[];
   }
   ```
   - Track peer task completion history and responsiveness
   - Implement reputation scoring with gradual decay and recovery
   - Rerank task queue to prioritize tasks from reliable peers
   - Skip tasks from peers deemed "lazy" until they complete other tasks

4. **Failure Detection and Recovery**
   - Monitor task completion broadcasts in the pubsub group
   - Detect missing responses from responsible peers
   - Implement deterministic fallback mechanism for unprocessed tasks
   - Provide system-wide visibility into task processing state

## Conclusion

By rewriting Goose features in TypeScript and tightly integrating them with the SwissKnife system, while leveraging IPFS Kit as a loosely coupled storage medium, we will create a powerful, flexible system with advanced reasoning capabilities. The integration of tasknet enhancements will further improve the system's ability to handle complex problems through sophisticated task decomposition and delegation.

This architecture balances the need for tight coupling of most components with the benefits of a specialized storage system, resulting in a cohesive yet flexible solution that builds on the strengths of all contributing systems.
