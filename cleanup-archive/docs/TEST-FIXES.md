# SwissKnife Test Fixes

This document provides an overview of the changes made to fix failing tests in the SwissKnife codebase, particularly focusing on Phase 3 components (TaskNet Enhancement).

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Component Implementations

- **FibonacciHeapScheduler**: Added the missing `decreaseKey` method to properly adjust priorities in the scheduler.
- **MerkleClock**: Added missing `getNodeId` and `getHash` methods for clock coordination.
- **GraphOfThought**: Ensured proper `traverse` implementation to navigate graph structures.

### 2. Jest Configuration

Created enhanced Jest configurations that address:
- ESM/CommonJS interoperability issues
- Module resolution for `.js` extensions in imports
- Proper transformer setup for TypeScript files
- Text encoder polyfills for Node.js environment

### 3. Test Environment

- Created a robust test setup file that handles environment variables, polyfills, and mocks
- Fixed module mocking strategies to properly isolate test components
- Added comprehensive test runners for targeted testing

## Test Files

The key test files that were fixed and validated are:
- `test/unit/phase3/components.test.js` - Tests all Phase 3 components individually
- `test/integration/phase3/integration.test.js` - Tests the integration of components in workflows

## How to Run Tests

### Run All Phase 3 Tests
```bash
npx jest "test/unit/phase3|test/integration/phase3" --config=jest.consolidated.config.cjs
```

### Run Component Tests Only
```bash
npx jest test/unit/phase3/components.test.js --config=jest.consolidated.config.cjs
```

### Run Integration Tests Only
```bash
npx jest test/integration/phase3/integration.test.js --config=jest.consolidated.config.cjs
```

## Additional Test Assets

- `phase3-implementation-report.md` - Detailed report on the implementation status
- `fixed.phase3.config.cjs` - Jest configuration specifically optimized for Phase 3 tests
- `jest.consolidated.config.cjs` - Comprehensive Jest configuration with all fixes

## Summary

The Phase 3 components (TaskNet Enhancement) are now fully implemented and tested. All unit tests and integration tests are passing. The implementation provides proper scheduling, graph traversal, and clock coordination as required for the project specifications.
