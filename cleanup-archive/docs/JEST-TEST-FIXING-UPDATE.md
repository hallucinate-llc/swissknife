# SwissKnife Test Improvement - Supplemental Report

## Progress Update - May 21, 2025

This document provides a supplemental update to the `JEST-TEST-FIXING-REPORT.md` and details additional progress made since the initial report.

## Latest Test Status

We've made significant progress in fixing the test suite. Currently:

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| test/unit/tasks/fibonacci-heap.test.ts | ✅ PASS | Successfully fixed with proper exports and path resolution |
| test/mcp-minimal.test.js | ✅ PASS | Basic MCP functionality tests now pass |
| test/model_selector.test.tsx | ❌ FAIL | Improved React/Ink mocking but still has some issues |
| test/unit/models/registry.test.ts | ❌ FAIL | Import path issues require further refinement |
| test/simplified-execution-service.test.js | ❌ FAIL | Requires additional work for MCP integration |
| test/simple-storage.test.js | ❌ FAIL | Path resolution issues remain |
| test/simple-registry.test.js | ❌ FAIL | Path resolution issues remain |

## New Scripts and Tools

In addition to the tools mentioned in the main report, we've created several new scripts:

1. **`final-fibonacci-heap-fix.sh`**: Comprehensive fix for the FibonacciHeap implementation and tests
   - Properly exports FibHeapNode at the module level
   - Fixes destructuring assignment issues
   - Creates TypeScript type definitions
   - Updates test assertions to Jest style

2. **`final-model-selector-fix.sh`**: Enhanced fix for React/Ink component testing
   - Creates better mocks for React hooks that actually maintain state
   - Improves Ink component mocking with better simulation
   - Adds Jest timer mocking for async operations

3. **`final-test-runner.sh`**: Comprehensive test runner with detailed reporting
   - Runs all tests in isolation
   - Generates a detailed report with timing information
   - Provides a summary of passed/failed tests
   - Creates a master fix script

## Key Improvements Since Initial Report

### 1. TypeScript Type Definitions

We've created proper TypeScript type definitions for key JavaScript implementations:

```typescript
// For FibonacciHeap
export interface FibHeapNode<T> {
  key: number;
  value: T;
  degree: number;
  marked: boolean;
  parent: FibHeapNode<T> | null;
  child: FibHeapNode<T> | null;
  left: FibHeapNode<T>;
  right: FibHeapNode<T>;
}

export class FibonacciHeap<T> {
  isEmpty(): boolean;
  size(): number;
  findMin(): T | null;
  // ... other methods
}
```

### 2. Better React Hook Mocking

We've enhanced React hook mocking to actually maintain component state:

```javascript
// Create useState implementation that actually stores state
const mockUseState = jest.fn((initialValue) => {
  const id = stateCounter++;
  if (!mockStates.has(id)) {
    mockStates.set(id, initialValue);
  }
  
  const setState = jest.fn((newValue) => {
    if (typeof newValue === 'function') {
      mockStates.set(id, newValue(mockStates.get(id)));
    } else {
      mockStates.set(id, newValue);
    }
  });
  
  return [mockStates.get(id), setState];
});
```

### 3. Direct Testing Approach

We've expanded our direct testing approach for core components:

```javascript
// Direct FibonacciHeap test
import { FibonacciHeap } from './src/tasks/scheduler/fibonacci-heap.js';

// Create a new heap
const heap = new FibonacciHeap();

// Test basic operations
console.log('Initial state: isEmpty() =', heap.isEmpty(), 'size() =', heap.size());

// Insert some values
heap.insert(5, 'value-5');
heap.insert(3, 'value-3');
heap.insert(7, 'value-7');

// Verify correct operation
console.log('After insertions: isEmpty() =', heap.isEmpty(), 'size() =', heap.size());
console.log('Min value should be value-3:', heap.findMin());
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Test Fixes**: Continue applying our proven patterns to fix the remaining tests
2. **Normalize Import Patterns**: Standardize import patterns across all test files
3. **Enhance Test Documentation**: Update developer documentation with best practices
4. **CI Integration**: Add test pipeline to continuous integration

## Conclusion

The SwissKnife test suite continues to improve with each iteration. By addressing core infrastructure issues and establishing patterns for specific component types, we're building a more robust testing environment. The next phase will focus on applying these established patterns to fix all remaining tests and increase overall test coverage.
