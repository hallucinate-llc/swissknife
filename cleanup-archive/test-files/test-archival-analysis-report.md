# Test Archival Analysis Report
Generated: $(date)

## Summary of Findings

Based on systematic analysis of duplicate test files (active tests that also exist in archived form), I've identified clear patterns that guide archival decisions.

## Category A: Empty Active Files with Archived Content (HIGH PRIORITY - RESTORE CONTENT)

These active test files are empty (0 bytes) but have meaningful content in the archive. These appear to have been accidentally emptied and should be restored from archive:

- absolute-minimal.test.js (archived: 369 bytes)
- basic-error.test.js (archived: 947 bytes) 
- basic.test.js (archived: 681 bytes)
- extra-minimal.test.js (archived: 609 bytes)
- fresh-minimal.test.js (archived: 727 bytes)
- minimal.test.js (archived: 521 bytes)
- super-minimal.test.js (archived: 289 bytes)
- ultra-basic.test.js (archived: 381 bytes)
- ultra-minimal-fixed.test.js (archived: 524 bytes)
- ultra-simple-corrected.test.js (archived: 476 bytes)

**Action Required**: Restore content from archived versions to active files.

## Category B: Active Files Larger Than Archived (ARCHIVE OLD VERSIONS)

These active files are larger and likely more recent/complete than their archived versions:

- api_key_persistence.test.js (active: 15,096 vs archived: 14,856 bytes)

**Action Required**: Archive the older, smaller versions since active is more complete.

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Restore Empty Active Files
The empty active files should be restored from their archived versions since they contain actual test logic.

### 2. Archive Superseded Versions  
Files where the active version is larger/newer should have their archived versions moved to a "superseded" folder.

### 3. Manual Review Required
Some files may need individual content comparison to determine which version is more comprehensive.

## Next Steps

1. Restore content for empty active files
2. Run tests to verify functionality
3. Archive superseded versions
4. Document archival decisions
5. Update test suite to ensure no regressions

## Import Issues Fixed

✅ EventBus - Added getInstance() singleton method and import
✅ TaskManager - Added import to phase5.test.js  
✅ CommandRegistry - Updated import path for TypeScript file

These fixes allow the test framework to run properly for evaluation.
