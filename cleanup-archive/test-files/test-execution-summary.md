# SwissKnife Test Execution Summary

This document summarizes our test execution approach and findings for the SwissKnife project.

## Test Organization

The SwissKnife project uses Jest for testing and organizes tests in several categories:

1. **Unit Tests**: Located in `/test/unit/`, these tests verify individual components.
2. **Integration Tests**: Located in `/test/integration/`, these tests verify interactions between components.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Located in `/test/e2e/`, these test full workflows.
4. **Benchmark Tests**: Located in `/test/benchmark/`, these measure performance.
5. **Phase-specific Tests**: The project organizes functionality by "phases" (1-5).

## Challenges Encountered

During test execution, we encountered several challenges:

1. **Module Resolution Issues**: Many tests failed with module not found errors, suggesting the project's complex module structure requires specific Jest configurations.
2. **ESM vs CommonJS Conflicts**: The project uses both module systems which causes compatibility issues.
3. **Mock Implementation Gaps**: Some mocks used in tests need additional implementation.
4. **Test Environment Requirements**: Some tests require specific environment setup.
5. **Path Differences**: Tests reference modules with paths that might be different in the actual build.

## Test Execution Strategy

To run core tests excluding CLI and GUI components, we recommend:

1. **Using Phase-Based Testing**: The project already includes phase-specific test scripts in package.json.
2. **Custom Jest Configuration**: We created dedicated Jest configurations for different test scenarios.
3. **Focused Test Execution**: Running specific component tests rather than all tests at once.
4. **Mock Enhancement**: Providing additional mock implementations for dependencies.

## Recommended Approach

To effectively test the core functionality:

```bash
# Run core tests using custom configuration
npx jest --config jest-core.config.cjs "test/unit/(!(cli|ux))/.*"

# Run phase tests individually
npm run test:phase1
npm run test:phase2
npm run test:phase3
npm run test:phase4

# Run specific component tests
npx jest test/unit/utils --config jest-focused.config.cjs
```

## Key Test Configurations

We've created several Jest configurations:

1. `jest-core.config.cjs`: Excludes CLI/GUI components while testing core functionality
2. `jest-simple.config.cjs`: Simplified configuration for basic tests
3. `jest-focused.config.cjs`: Configuration for targeted component testing

## Conclusion

The SwissKnife tests require a specific environment and configuration to run successfully. Some tests pass individually but fail when run in bulk due to dependency issues. Using the phase-based organization built into the project is the most reliable approach for testing core functionality.
