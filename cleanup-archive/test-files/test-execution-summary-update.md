# SwissKnife Test Execution Summary Update

## Current Test Status

The core functionality tests for the SwissKnife project have been analyzed with significant improvements made to the testing infrastructure. However, several test failures have been identified that require attention.

## Recent Improvements

1. **Enhanced Mock Implementations**
   - Updated MCP client mock with more robust functionality
   - Created comprehensive model registry mock
   - Fixed chai stub to support both ESM and CommonJS modules
   - Added detailed error handling and simulation

2. **Optimized Test Configurations**
   - Created specialized Jest configs for core functionality
   - Added TypeScript-specific test configuration
   - Improved module resolution and path mapping
   - Enhanced test setup with additional utilities

3. **More Robust Test Runner**
   - Created both CommonJS and ESM versions of test runner
   - Added categorized test execution
   - Implemented detailed test reporting
   - Added flexible configuration options

## Test Failure Analysis

### Storage Tests

The storage tests are exhibiting several failures that can be categorized as:

1. **Mock Implementation Mismatches**
   - MCPClient mock methods not being called with expected parameters
   - Return value structure mismatches between real and mock implementations
   - Missing method implementations in mock objects

2. **Error Handling Differences**
   - Error message format differences between mock expectations and implementations
   - Inconsistent error handling in storage implementation vs. test expectations

3. **File System Issues**
   - Temporary directory access problems for FileStorage tests
   - Metadata file not found in FileStorage implementation

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Align Mock Implementations**
   - Update the MCP client mock to ensure pinContent is properly called and tracked
   - Fix return value structures to match expected formats in tests
   - Ensure error messages match exactly what tests expect

2. **FileStorage Fixes**
   - Verify temp directory creation logic for test isolation
   - Ensure metadata file is properly initialized before first use
   - Fix error message formatting to match test expectations

3. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Create a consistent error handling pattern across all storage implementations
   - Update tests to use the standardized error messages

4. **Update Test Assertions**
   - Update list() method tests to handle the { cids: [...] } return format
   - Fix error message assertions to match the actual implementation

## Priority Test Categories

Based on the analysis, the following test categories should be prioritized:

1. **Critical (storage, models)**: Fix basic storage functionality
2. **Utils**: Ensure utility functions are working correctly
3. **Services**: Address service-level integrations
4. **Integration**: Fix end-to-end integration tests

## Next Testing Steps

1. Run `node run-core-tests.mjs --category utils --config jest-ts.config.cjs` to verify utility functions
2. Fix identified storage test issues one by one
3. Run integration tests after storage functionality is fixed
4. Update model tests to align with enhanced model registry mock

## Conclusion

The test infrastructure has been significantly improved, but several implementation details still need to be aligned between the tests and the actual code. By following the recommended steps, we can systematically address the test failures and improve the overall quality of the codebase.
