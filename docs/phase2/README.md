# Phase 2: Core Implementation

**Duration:** 4 Weeks

This phase focuses on implementing the core functionality for each major domain within the unified SwissKnife architecture, as outlined in the [Integration Master Plan](../integration_plan/INTEGRATION_MASTER_PLAN.md). Building upon the foundational structure established in Phase 1, Phase 2 aims to bring the essential capabilities of the system to life.

## Goals

Based on the [Phase 2 Detailed Plan](../phases/02_core_implementation.md), the primary goals for this phase are:

1.  **Implement AI Domain:** Develop the core AI agent capabilities, including the tool system, model integration infrastructure, and initial thinking patterns (Graph-of-Thought).
2.  **Build ML Acceleration Domain:** Create the necessary components for machine learning acceleration, such as tensor operations and interfaces for hardware accelerators (WebGPU, WebNN, WASM, CPU).
3.  **Create Task Processing System:** Implement the advanced task processing system featuring the Fibonacci heap scheduler and the Graph-of-Thought implementation for task decomposition and management.
4.  **Develop Storage System:** Build the storage domain, focusing on the integration with the IPFS Kit MCP Server via a dedicated client, alongside local storage and caching mechanisms.
5.  **Implement CLI System:** Develop the command system for the Command Line Interface.
6.  **Establish Cross-Domain Communication:** Ensure seamless interaction between the different domains by implementing and testing the defined interfaces and creating basic cross-domain workflows.

## Scope

This phase involves significant implementation work across the following key domains:

-   [AI Domain](./01_ai_domain.md)
-   [ML Domain](./02_ml_domain.md)
-   [Task System](./03_task_system.md)
-   [Storage System](./04_storage_system.md)
-   [CLI System](./05_cli_system.md)
-   [Cross-Domain Interfaces](./06_cross_domain_interfaces.md)

The focus is on building robust, functional core components for each domain, enabling basic end-to-end workflows and setting the stage for advanced feature implementation in subsequent phases. Integration testing between domains is a critical aspect of this phase.
