# CLI Integration Roadmap

This document provides a high-level strategic overview and timeline for the entire SwissKnife integration project, encompassing the reimplementation of Goose features in TypeScript, integration with the IPFS Kit MCP Server, and the incorporation of TaskNet enhancements into a unified CLI architecture. It outlines the major phases, key milestones, and guiding principles for the development effort.

## Strategic Objectives

The CLI integration effort is guided by the following strategic objectives:

1. **Clean Room TypeScript Implementation**: Independently implement required functionality in TypeScript, based on understanding the *behavior* of source components, not direct code translation. Ensures an idiomatic, maintainable codebase free from source code licensing constraints. (See [../CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](../CLEAN_ROOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md)).
2. **Tight Internal Coupling**: Design core SwissKnife components (Agent, Task System, etc.) to integrate closely within the Node.js process for efficiency.
3. **Loose External Coupling (IPFS Kit)**: Integrate with the IPFS Kit MCP Server via its defined API, treating it as an external dependency accessed through `IPFSClient`.
4. **Enhanced Task Processing**: Implement advanced TaskNet features (GoT, scheduling, decomposition, delegation) for sophisticated workflow management.
5. **CLI-First & Node.js Native**: Prioritize the command-line user experience and leverage Node.js runtime capabilities, excluding browser-specific APIs.
6. **Performance & Optimization**: Build an efficient, responsive CLI, optimizing critical paths and resource usage (memory, startup time).

## Integration Phases Overview

The integration will proceed through five major phases, each building on the previous ones to create a cohesive, powerful CLI application.

### Phase 1: Analysis and TypeScript Architecture Design (Weeks 1-2)

**Focus**: Analyze source components, define the target TypeScript architecture, and plan the integration.

**Key Activities**:
- Analyze source features (`swissknife_old`, `ipfs_accelerate_js/py`) for CLI relevance and reimplementation requirements.
- Design the core TypeScript architecture (services, layers, modules - see `../UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- Define key TypeScript interfaces (`api_specifications.md`) for major components (Agent, Storage, Task, ModelProvider, etc.).
- Define the interface/client strategy for IPFS Kit MCP Server communication (`IPFSClient`).
- Develop the overall CLI Test Strategy (`cli_test_strategy.md`) and plan template (`test_plan_template.md`).
- Establish coding standards, documentation structure, and project setup (`../CONTRIBUTING.md`, `../PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`).
- Perform initial risk assessment (`risk_assessment.md`) and technical challenge analysis (`technical_challenges.md`).
- Create component inventory (`component_inventory.md`) and mapping (`component_mapping.md`).

**Major Milestones**:
- Completion of Phase 1 Documentation (Analysis, Architecture, APIs, Strategy, Plan, Risks, Mapping).
- Agreed-upon TypeScript architecture and core interfaces.
- Established project standards and testing framework outline.

**Strategic Value**: This phase establishes the foundation for TypeScript implementation, ensuring a clear path for reimplementing Goose functionality.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 3-6)

## Integration Strategy Summary

The integration will follow these key strategic principles:

1. **TypeScript-First Development**: Implement all components in TypeScript for tight integration
2. **Interface-Driven Design**: Define clear interfaces before implementation to ensure coherence
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Implement comprehensive tests for each component
4. **Documentation Alongside Code**: Create documentation as components are developed
5. **Performance-Conscious Implementation**: Optimize TypeScript code for performance where critical

## Component Dependencies (Simplified)

The integration sequence is driven by key dependencies:

```
*The `Execution Context` provides command handlers access to all necessary services.*

## TypeScript Implementation Strategy

The TypeScript implementation will focus on:

1. **Modern TypeScript Patterns**:
   - Type-safe interfaces and generics (`src/types/`)
   - Asynchronous programming with Promises/async-await
   - Functional programming where appropriate (`src/utils/`)
   - Class-based components for core functionality/services

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Efficient data structures (Maps, Sets, Fibonacci Heap)
   - Memory management best practices (streaming, avoiding leaks)
   - Lazy loading and computation (dynamic `import()`, lazy service init)
   - Strategic caching (in-memory, filesystem)

3. **Testing Approach**:
   - Unit tests for TypeScript components (Jest)
   - Integration tests for service interaction (Jest, mocks)
   - E2E tests for CLI behavior (`child_process`)
   - Type validation (`tsc --noEmit`)
   - Performance benchmarking (`hyperfine`, custom scripts)

## Success Criteria

The integration will be considered successful when:

1. All required features (based on analysis of sources and new requirements) are implemented in TypeScript.
2. The system adheres to the defined unified architecture and interfaces.
3. IPFS Kit MCP Server is successfully integrated via the `IPFSClient`.
4. TaskNet enhancements (GoT, Scheduler, etc.) provide improved workflow capabilities.
5. Performance (startup, execution time, memory) meets defined targets.
6. Documentation is complete, accurate, and consistent.
7. All automated tests pass across all supported platforms.
8. A stable release candidate is produced.
