`[Clearly describe what aspects of the component WILL be tested. Be specific about features, functions, APIs, CLI commands (if applicable), and integration points covered by this plan. Example: "Testing includes registration of model providers, model lookup by ID and capabilities, retrieval of model metadata, and integration with the ModelSelector."]`

### 2.2 Test Objectives

`[List the specific, measurable goals of testing this component. What questions should testing answer? Examples:]`
- `[Verify that model providers can be registered and retrieved correctly.]`
- `[Ensure model selection logic returns appropriate models based on various criteria (capabilities, cost, context window).]`
- `[Validate that all public methods of the component behave as specified in the API documentation.]`
- `[Confirm error handling for invalid inputs or unavailable dependencies.]`
- `[Measure the performance of key operations (e.g., model lookup time) against defined targets.]`

### 2.3 Out of Scope

`[Explicitly list any related aspects or features that WILL NOT be tested under this plan and provide the reason. Example: "Testing of individual model provider API interactions (covered in provider-specific integration tests)", "End-to-end testing of AI agent workflows using the model registry (covered in Agent system tests)", "Load testing beyond N concurrent requests."]`

  beforeEach(() => {
    registryMock = new (ModelRegistry as any)() as jest.Mocked<ModelRegistry>;
    registryMock.getAvailableModels.mockReturnValue(models);
    selector = new ModelSelector(registryMock);
  });

  it('should select the cheapest model meeting capability requirements', () => {
    // Arrange
    const requirements: ModelRequirements = { capabilities: { chat: true }, maxCost: 0.002 };
    
    // Act

  let configManager: ConfigurationManager;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup mock config data
    const mockConfigData = { api: { mock: { key: 'test-key' } } };
    // Use a real config manager instance, potentially with mocked file reads
    configManager = new ConfigurationManager(/* ... options ... */);
    jest.spyOn(configManager, 'get').mockImplementation((key) => /* return mockConfigData value */);

    registry = new ModelRegistry();
    // Assume registerProviders function uses configManager.get('api...')
    registerProviders(registry, configManager); // Function that registers providers based on config
  });

  it('should register providers based on configuration', () => {
    // Act
    const provider = registry.getProvider('mock'); // Assuming MockModelProvider has id 'mock'

    // Assert

    // Check if provider was initialized correctly using config
  });
});
```
    
    // Execute
    const result = await componentFunction(input);
    
    // Assert integration result
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('dependencyData');

### 8.1 Test Execution Process

`[Describe the typical flow for running tests.]`
1.  **Local Development:** Developers run relevant unit and integration tests locally (`npm test -- src/component/file.test.ts` or `npm run test:component`) before committing code. Pre-commit hooks may run linters and potentially fast unit tests.
2.  **Pull Request (PR):** CI pipeline automatically runs the full suite of unit and integration tests for the changed components and potentially core E2E tests on a primary platform (e.g., Linux). Build must pass, and coverage must meet thresholds for PR to be mergeable.
3.  **Main Branch Merge:** CI pipeline runs the *full* test suite (unit, integration, E2E) across *all* target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). Performance benchmarks may also run.
4.  **Nightly/Scheduled Builds:** Full test suite, including longer-running performance and scalability tests, executed on a regular schedule against the main branch.
5.  **Release Candidate:** Full test suite, plus dedicated manual testing and installation testing on all platforms before tagging a release.

### 8.2 CI/CD Integration

`[Provide details on CI/CD setup.]`
-   **Platform:** `[e.g., GitHub Actions]`
-   **Triggers:** `[e.g., push to main, pull_request to main, schedule (nightly), release tag]`
-   **Workflow Stages:** `[e.g., Lint -> Build -> Unit Tests -> Integration Tests (Matrix) -> E2E Tests (Matrix) -> Coverage Report -> Performance Benchmarks (Optional)]`
-   **Reporting:** `[e.g., Test results uploaded as artifacts, coverage reported to Codecov/Coveralls, performance metrics logged or compared against baseline.]`

### 8.3 Test Environment Setup Script (Example)

`[Provide an example script or steps needed to set up a clean test environment, if applicable beyond simple npm install.]`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e # Exit on error

echo "Setting up test environment..."

# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci

# 2. Build the project (needed for E2E tests)
npm run build

# 3. Set required environment variables for testing
export NODE_ENV=test
export LOG_LEVEL=warn
# export MOCK_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9999 # If using mock server
# export TEST_API_KEY=dummy-key # For controlled external API tests

# 4. Start mock services (if needed)
# (e.g., docker-compose up -d mock-ipfs-server)

# 5. Generate necessary test data (if not done in test setup)
# node scripts/generate-test-data.js

echo "Test environment ready."
```

## 11. Test Automation

Describes the strategy for automating tests.

### 11.1 Automation Approach

-   **Primary Framework:** Jest will be used for unit and integration tests due to its built-in features for mocking, assertions, and coverage.
-   **E2E Testing:** A helper utility (`executeCommand`, `executeTimedCommand`, potentially `executeInteractive`) based on Node.js `child_process` will be developed for executing the CLI and asserting on its output/exit code.
-   **CI Integration:** All automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) will be executed automatically via GitHub Actions on relevant triggers (PRs, merges to main).
-   **Focus:** Automate as much as possible, prioritizing unit and integration tests for component logic and E2E tests for critical user workflows and CLI contract validation. Manual testing will focus on exploratory testing, complex UI interactions, and platform-specific edge cases.

### 11.2 Automation Scope

-   **Automated:** All unit tests, most integration tests (using mocks for external APIs where necessary), core E2E command tests (argument parsing, basic output, error handling), performance benchmarks.
-   **Manual/Semi-Automated:** Complex interactive CLI workflows, visual TUI rendering checks across different terminals, installation on diverse environments, exploratory testing.

### 11.3 Automation Scripts Organization

| **Test Plan Author** | Jane Smith |
| **Test Plan Date** | 2023-04-15 |
| **Test Plan Version** | 1.0 |

## 2. Scope and Objectives

### 2.1 Test Scope

This test plan covers the Virtual Filesystem component's core functionality including file operations (read, write, delete), directory operations (list, create, delete), and backend switching. It includes testing of both local filesystem and IPFS storage backends.

### 2.2 Test Objectives

- Verify all filesystem operations work correctly with local backend
- Verify all filesystem operations work correctly with IPFS backend
- Ensure proper error handling for all operations
- Validate performance meets requirements for common operations
- Verify filesystem path resolution works correctly
- Confirm backend switching works seamlessly

### 2.3 Out of Scope

- Testing of other storage backends not yet implemented
- Exhaustive performance testing under extreme loads
- Security penetration testing (covered by separate security test plan)

## 3. Test Approach

### 3.1 Test Levels

| Test Level | Applicable | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Unit Testing | Yes | Test individual methods and functions in isolation with mocked dependencies |
| Integration Testing | Yes | Test interaction between filesystem and storage backends |
| System Testing | Yes | Test filesystem within the context of the full CLI application |
| Performance Testing | Yes | Test file operations with various file sizes and quantities |
| Security Testing | Yes | Test for path traversal vulnerabilities and permission issues |

### 3.2 Test Environment

| Environment | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Development | Local Node.js v18.x environment with local filesystem access |
| Testing | CI environment with ephemeral filesystem and mock IPFS service |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions runners with controlled test dataset |

### 3.3 Test Data Requirements

- Small test files (< 1KB) for basic operations
- Medium test files (1MB) for standard operations
- Large test files (100MB) for performance testing
- Special character filenames for path handling tests
- Mock IPFS responses for IPFS backend testing

## 4. Test Scenarios

### 4.1 Unit Test Scenarios

| ID | Test Scenario | Test Description | Test Data | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|--------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| U1 | Read File Success | Test reading an existing file | Small text file | File content returned correctly | High |
| U2 | Read File Failure | Test reading a non-existent file | Non-existent path | FileNotFoundError thrown | High |
| U3 | Write File Success | Test writing content to a file | Text content, target path | File created with correct content | High |
...

### 4.2 Integration Test Scenarios

| ID | Test Scenario | Test Description | Component Interactions | Test Data | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|--------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| I1 | Local Backend Integration | Test filesystem operations with local backend | VFS + Local Storage | Various files | All operations work as expected | High |
| I2 | IPFS Backend Integration | Test filesystem operations with IPFS backend | VFS + IPFS Client | Various files | All operations work as expected | High |
| I3 | Backend Switching | Test switching between storage backends | VFS + Multiple Backends | Configuration change | Seamless switching without data loss | Medium |
