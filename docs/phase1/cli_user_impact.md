# CLI User Impact Analysis

This document analyzes the anticipated impact on end-users resulting from the integration of components and architectural changes planned for SwissKnife (as outlined in Phase 1 documentation). It covers changes to existing commands, new capabilities, potential disruptions, and recommendations for user migration. Understanding this impact is crucial for managing user expectations and ensuring a smooth transition.

## 1. Command Behavior Changes

### 1.1 Core Command Changes

| Command Group | Current Behavior (Simplified) | New Behavior | Impact Level | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| `model ...` | Basic model selection via ID. | Enhanced selection (capabilities, cost), registry management, potential local model support. | Medium | Core usage similar, but advanced features added. |
| `config ...` | Simple flat key-value store (JSON/TOML). | Hierarchical loading (global, user, project), schema validation, potentially different format (JSON primary). | High | Requires understanding new structure and **migrating existing configs**. Offers more power. |
| `agent ...` / `tools ...` | Fixed tool set, basic agent interaction. | Pluggable tool system, more sophisticated agent interaction (GoT), direct tool execution. | Medium | Core agent interaction similar, but tool management and advanced reasoning are new. |
| `mcp ...` | Basic MCP server management. | Enhanced capabilities via SDK, potentially more transport options, clearer separation from core CLI. | Medium | Existing users might need to adapt to SDK-based commands/concepts. |
| `storage ...` / `file ...` / `ipfs ...` | Likely separate or limited file/IPFS commands. | Unified VFS (`storage`, `file`) with distinct backends (local, IPFS). Dedicated `ipfs` commands for IPFS-specific actions. | High | Introduces VFS concept. Consolidates/replaces older file commands. |
| `task ...` / `worker ...` | Minimal or non-existent. | New comprehensive TaskNet system (scheduling, decomposition, GoT, workers). | High (New) | Completely new functionality set. |
| `ml ...` | Minimal or non-existent. | New commands for managing and running local ML models via MLEngine. | High (New) | New capability for local inference. |

| **IPFS Operations** | Network latency affecting command speed. Daemon resource usage (if running locally). | Caching in Storage Service. Clear feedback during network operations. User manages their own IPFS daemon/gateway configuration. |
| **Complex TaskNet Workflows** | Overhead from scheduling, decomposition, GoT processing. | Efficient implementation of core TaskNet components. Optimization in Phase 5. |
| **First Run / Initialization** | Initial setup (config, downloads, key generation) might take longer. | Streamlined onboarding process. Clear progress indication. |

**User Impact Summary:**
- While overall performance should improve, new features like local ML or complex TaskNet workflows introduce new potential resource demands.
- Users need to be aware of the requirements and configuration options for these advanced features.
- Network latency will remain a factor for IPFS-dependent operations.

## 5. Configuration Changes

### 5.1 Configuration File Format

**Current Format (Assumed Simple JSON/TOML):**
```json
// Example old config.json
{
  "default_model": "gpt-4",
  "api_key_openai": "sk-...", // Plaintext key - SECURITY RISK!
  "ipfs_gateway": "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
}
```

**New Format (Hierarchical JSON with Secure Storage):**
```json
// Example new ~/.config/swissknife/config.json
{
  "agent": {
    "defaultModel": "openai/gpt-4-turbo"
  },
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      // API key stored securely in keychain/env var, NOT here.
      "defaultTemperature": 0.7
    },
    "anthropic": { /* ... */ }
  },
  "storage": {
    "mounts": {
      "/": { "backendId": "local-default" },
      "/ipfs": { "backendId": "ipfs-main" }
    },
    "backends": {
      "local-default": {
        "type": "filesystem",
        "baseDir": "~/SwissKnifeData" // Example path
      },
      "ipfs-main": {
        "type": "ipfs",
        "apiUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:5001", // URL for IPFS Kit Client
        "mappingStorePath": "~/.config/swissknife/ipfs-map.db" // Example path
      }
    }
  },
  "output": {
    "defaultFormat": "text",
    "verbose": false,
    "color": true
  }
  // ... other sections (tasks, ml, auth)
}
```

**User Impact:**
- **Migration Required:** Users *must* migrate their existing configuration (especially API keys) to the new structure and secure storage (keychain or env vars). Plaintext keys in old config files will no longer work and pose a security risk.
- **Increased Complexity:** The new format is more complex but also more powerful and organized.
- **Benefit:** Allows much finer-grained control over different components (models, storage backends, output) and significantly improves security for credentials.
- **Mitigation:** Provide a `swissknife config migrate` command or clear documentation to assist users in transitioning their settings, especially API keys to secure storage (`apikey add` command).

### 5.2 Environment Variables

*Focus shifts towards hierarchical config files and secure storage, but key overrides via env vars remain useful.*

| Environment Variable | Purpose | Overrides Config Path | Notes |
|----------------------|---------|-----------------------|-------|
| `SWISSKNIFE_CONFIG_PATH` | Specify path to user config file | `N/A` | Useful for testing or isolated configs. |
| `SWISSKNIFE_NO_COLOR` / `NO_COLOR` | Disable colored output | `output.color` | Standard convention. |
| `SWISSKNIFE_LOG_LEVEL` | Set logging level | `logging.level` (if exists) | e.g., `debug`, `info`. |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug namespaces | `N/A` | Standard Node.js `debug` library usage. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Provide OpenAI Key | (Read by `ApiKeyManager`) | Standard practice. Preferred over config file. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`| Provide Anthropic Key | (Read by `ApiKeyManager`) | Standard practice. Preferred over config file. |
| `LILYPAD_API_KEY` / `ANURA_API_KEY` | Provide Lilypad Key | (Read by `ApiKeyManager`) | Standard practice. Preferred over config file. |
| `IPFS_API_URL` | Set IPFS API URL | `storage.backends.ipfs-*.apiUrl` | Override default connection. |
| `SWISSKNIFE_MAX_WORKERS` | Limit local worker threads | `tasks.workers.maxPoolSize` | Performance tuning. |

**User Impact Summary:**
- Environment variables provide a convenient way to override specific settings, especially for API keys and in CI/CD or containerized environments.
- Priority: Env Var > Secure Storage (Keychain) > Project Config > User Config > Global Config > Defaults.
- Secure handling of API keys via env vars requires careful environment management by the user.
