   - User experience is polished
   - Performance meets targets

## Dependencies

- Completed Phase 4 CLI integration
- All core functionality implemented
- Test infrastructure in place
- Documentation framework established

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Performance targets not met | Identify bottlenecks early, implement focused optimizations, consider architectural changes if necessary |
| Test coverage gaps | Prioritize critical functionality, implement automated coverage monitoring, use property-based testing |
| Documentation incompleteness | Create documentation templates, review systematically, automate where possible (API docs) |
| Release issues | Create release checklist, implement smoke tests, prepare rollback procedures |

## Future Directions

With the completion of Phase 5, the SwissKnife integration project will have successfully:
- Implemented Goose features in TypeScript
- Integrated with IPFS Kit MCP Server
- Enhanced task processing with Graph-of-Thought
- Created a unified CLI experience

Future development could include:
1. **Web Interface**: Creating a web-based UI for SwissKnife
2. **Plugin System**: Developing a plugin architecture for extensions
3. **Multi-Modal Support**: Adding image, audio, and video capabilities
4. **Distributed Computing**: Enabling cross-machine task delegation
5. **Enterprise Features**: Adding security, compliance, and management features
