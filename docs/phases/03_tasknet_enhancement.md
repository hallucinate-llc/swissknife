## Technical Details

### Fibonacci Heap and Merkle Clock Integration

A key innovation in this phase is the integration of the Fibonacci heap scheduler with the Merkle clock system for distributed task processing. This integration works as follows:

1. **Local Scheduling with Fibonacci Heap**
   - Tasks are prioritized and scheduled locally using the Fibonacci heap
   - When a task is extracted for execution, the system decides whether to:
     - Execute locally (for simple tasks or when distribution is disabled)
     - Distribute to the network (for complex tasks when distribution is enabled)

2. **Distribution using Merkle Clock**
   - When a task is selected for distribution:
     - The Merkle clock is updated with a new event for the task
     - The task is announced to the network with the current clock head
     - Peers calculate their Hamming distance to determine responsibility
     - The responsible peer executes the task and announces completion

3. **Task Execution Flow**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Local Task Queue│
   │ (Fibonacci Heap)│
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────┐     No      ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Should Distribute├────────────►│ Execute Locally │
   └────────┬────────┘              └─────────────────┘
            │ Yes
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Update Merkle   │
   │ Clock (tick)    │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
            ▼

   └────────┬────────┘

   └────────┬────────┘              └─────────────────┘
            │ Yes
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Execute Task    │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Store Result    │
   │ in IPFS         │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │ Announce        │
   │ Completion      │
   └─────────────────┘
   ```

4. **Priority and Responsibility Calculation**
   - The Fibonacci heap uses a sophisticated priority function that considers:
     - Base priority assigned to the task
     - Number of dependent tasks (critical path analysis)
     - Computational complexity estimate
     - Wait time in the queue (to prevent starvation)
     - Confidence in the task (higher confidence tasks prioritized)
     - Previous execution attempts (deprioritize repeatedly failing tasks)
   
   - The Hamming distance calculation determines task responsibility by:
     - Computing the distance between peer ID and task ID (or clock head)
     - Selecting the peer with minimum distance as responsible
     - Using consistent tie-breaking when distances are equal
     - Factoring in peer reliability based on past performance

### IPFS/IPLD Integration for Tasks

All task data is stored in IPFS using content addressing:

1. **Task Storage Structure**
   ```typescript
   interface TaskStorage {
     instructionsCid?: string;  // CID for task instructions
     dataCid?: string;          // CID for input data
     resultCid?: string;        // CID for result data
     graphCid?: string;         // CID for reasoning graph (for complex tasks)
   }
   ```

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement multi-level caching:
     - In-memory cache for frequent operations
     - Local storage for larger datasets
     - Memory-mapped files for very large data
   - Use content-based caching keyed by CID
   - Implement LRU eviction policy with size limits
   - Add TTL for cached items to ensure freshness

## Success Criteria

1. **Graph-of-Thought Performance**
   - Successfully decomposes complex problems into manageable subproblems
   - Demonstrates significant improvement over linear Chain-of-Thought
   - Produces well-reasoned answers with proper citations and justifications
   - Graph visualization shows clear reasoning paths

2. **Scheduler Efficiency**
   - Fibonacci heap operations maintain expected time complexity
   - Tasks are executed in optimal order based on priority
   - Dynamic priority adjustments correctly respond to system state changes
   - No task starvation occurs under normal load

3. **Distributed Processing**
   - Merkle clock correctly tracks event causality across nodes
   - Tasks are distributed to appropriate nodes based on Hamming distance
   - System handles node failures gracefully
   - Network overhead is minimal compared to computation time

4. **IPFS Integration**
   - All task data is properly stored in and retrieved from IPFS
   - Content deduplication works correctly
   - Caching system improves performance for repeated operations
   - Graphs are properly serialized to and deserialized from IPLD format

5. **Integration Quality**
