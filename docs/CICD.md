# SwissKnife CI/CD System

This document provides comprehensive information about the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) system used in the SwissKnife project.

## Overview

The SwissKnife CI/CD system automates building, testing, and deploying the SwissKnife application across different environments. It ensures code quality, performs comprehensive testing, and provides reliable deployment automation.

## CI Workflow

The CI workflow (`ci.yml`) runs on every push to main/develop branches and on pull requests. It ensures code quality and produces verified builds.

### CI Jobs (`ci.yml`)

1. **Validate & Lint**:
   - `pnpm run format:check`: Checks code formatting using Prettier.
   - `pnpm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code style and potential errors.
   - `pnpm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`) to verify type safety.
   *(Documentation generation might be manual or part of release process)*
2. **Test**:
   - `pnpm test`: Executes the full test suite (unit, integration, e2e) using Jest.
   - Generates code coverage reports.
   *(Specialized tests are typically included within the main test suites)*
3. **Security Scan**:
   - `pnpm audit`: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
   - Snyk Scan (if integrated): Performs deeper security analysis.
4. **Build**:
   - `bun run build`: Creates the production-ready executable using Bun (as defined in `package.json`). Requires Bun installation.
   - `pnpm run test:verify-build`: Runs basic smoke tests against the built artifact (`dist/cli.mjs`).
   - Uploads `dist/` directory as a build artifact.
5. **Benchmark** (Optional, e.g., on `main` branch push):
   - `pnpm run benchmark`: Runs performance benchmarks defined in `benchmark/`.
   - May compare results against a baseline.

## CD Workflow

The CD workflow (`cd.yml`) handles deployment to different environments.

### CD Jobs (`cd.yml`)

1. **Deploy to Staging** (Triggered on merge to `main`):
   - Downloads build artifact from CI run.
   - Configures environment variables/secrets for Staging.
   - Executes deployment script (`node scripts/deploy.js staging`) targeting the staging environment (e.g., specific server, cloud service).
   - Runs post-deployment verification tests (potentially using `jest.staging.config.js`).
   - Sends deployment status notification (e.g., Slack).
2. **Deploy to Production & Publish** (Triggered manually, e.g., on creating a GitHub Release/Tag):
   - Downloads build artifact.
   - Configures environment variables/secrets for Production.
   - Executes deployment script (`node scripts/deploy.js production`) targeting the production environment.
   - Publishes the package to npm using `npm publish` (requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret).
   - Creates GitHub Release notes (potentially automated).
   - Sends deployment status notification.

## Environment Configuration

The system supports two environments:

1. **Staging**
   - Used for testing before production
   - Has debug mode enabled
   - Experimental features enabled
   - Uses staging API endpoints

2. **Production**
   - Production-ready configuration
   - Debug mode disabled
   - Only stable features
   - Uses production API endpoints

## Required Secrets

The following GitHub Actions secrets need to be configured:

| Secret Name | Description | Used In |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `STAGING_API_URL` | Staging API endpoint URL | Staging deployment |
| `STAGING_API_KEY` | API key for staging | Staging deployment |
| `STAGING_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Deployment token for staging | Staging deployment |
| `PRODUCTION_API_URL` | Production API endpoint URL | Production deployment |
| `PRODUCTION_API_KEY` | API key for production | Production deployment |
| `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Deployment token for production | Production deployment |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | npm authentication token | npm publishing |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack webhook for notifications | Both workflows |
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | Snyk API token for security scanning | CI workflow |

## Scripts

The CI/CD system uses several custom scripts:

1. **configure.js**
   - Sets up environment-specific configuration
   - Creates .env file with correct variables
   - Usage: `node scripts/configure.js [staging|production]`

2. **deploy.js**
   - Handles deployment to different environments
   - Creates deployment packages
   - Simulates/performs deployment operations
   - Usage: `node scripts/deploy.js [staging|production]`

3. **verify-build.js**
   - Verifies the build output is functional
   - Runs smoke tests on the built CLI
   - Usage: `node test/verify-build.js`

4. **run.js (benchmarks)**
   - Runs performance benchmarks
   - Compares with previous benchmark results
   - Usage: `node benchmark/run.js`

## Testing Configuration

The project uses Jest for testing with separate configurations:

1. **`jest.config.cjs`**: Main Jest configuration used for local development and standard CI test runs (`pnpm test`). Covers unit, integration, and potentially E2E tests depending on setup.
2. **`jest.staging.config.js`** (if used): A separate Jest configuration potentially used specifically for running tests against a deployed *staging* environment during the CD workflow. This might involve different setup, timeouts, or test suites focused on verifying the deployed application.

## Using the CI/CD System

### Running Locally

Simulate CI/CD steps locally:

```bash
# Run CI checks (use pnpm or npm)
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test # Runs all tests

# Build the application (requires Bun)
bun run build

# Verify the build
pnpm run test:verify-build

# Simulate Staging Deployment (Dry Run)
# Ensure staging config/env vars are set appropriately if needed by deploy script
NODE_ENV=staging STAGING_DEPLOY_TOKEN=test-token node scripts/deploy.js staging --dry-run

# Simulate Production Deployment (Dry Run)
# Ensure production config/env vars are set appropriately if needed by deploy script
NODE_ENV=production PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_TOKEN=test-token node scripts/deploy.js production --dry-run
```
*(Note: Actual deployment simulation might require specific environment setup or secrets not available locally)*.

### Triggering Deployments

#### Automatic Deployments
- Merges to the `main` branch typically trigger an automatic deployment to the **Staging** environment.
- Creating a GitHub Release (tagging a commit, e.g., `v1.2.3`) typically triggers the **Production** deployment and subsequent **npm publish**.

#### Manual Deployments
1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "SwissKnife CD (Deployment)"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch, environment, and optional version
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Setting Up GitHub Actions Secrets

To set up the required secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Select "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each of the secrets listed in the "Required Secrets" section

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Check CI logs for specific errors from `bun run build`.
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pnpm install`).
   - Verify TypeScript checks pass (`pnpm run typecheck`).
   - Look for bundling issues mentioned in `BUILD_PROCESS.md`.
2. **Test Failures**:
   - Examine CI logs for failed Jest tests.
   - Run the specific failing test file locally (`npx jest <path/to/test.ts>`).
   - Debug the test logic or the source code. Check mock setups.
   - For E2E tests, check if the built application (`dist/cli.mjs`) runs correctly.
3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Verify required GitHub Actions secrets (`STAGING_DEPLOY_TOKEN`, `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_TOKEN`, `NPM_TOKEN`, etc.) are correctly configured in repository settings.
   - Check deployment script logs (`scripts/deploy.js`) for errors related to target environment access, authentication, or configuration.
   - Ensure the target deployment environment (server, service) is available and accessible.
4. **Module Resolution Errors in CI/Tests**:
    - As noted in the Developer Guide, ensure `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.cjs` are correctly configured for ES Modules and path aliases used in the project. This is a common source of CI failures if local setup differs slightly.
