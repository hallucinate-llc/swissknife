/**
 * Unit Tests for the MCP Command (`src/commands/mcp.js`).
 *
 * These tests verify the behavior of the `mcp` command handler,
 * focusing on how it interacts with the `mcpClient` service (mocked)
 * to display server status or indicate startup based on arguments.
 * It also checks the command's metadata.
 *
 * Dependencies (`mcpClient` service, logger, theme, constants) are mocked.
