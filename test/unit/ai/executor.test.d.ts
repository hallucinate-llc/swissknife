/**
 * Unit Tests for the ToolExecutor class (`src/ai/tools/executor.js`).
 *
 * These tests verify the core logic of the ToolExecutor, specifically its
 * ability to validate input against a tool's Zod schema and correctly
 * call the tool's execute method or handle validation/execution errors.
 *
 * Dependencies like logger are mocked. The Tool interface and implementations
 * are mocked within this file.
