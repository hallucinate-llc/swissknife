 * End-to-End Tests for Basic CLI Workflows

 * common user workflows involving core commands like help, version,
 * config, model execution, and basic task management.

 * It uses a temporary directory and configuration file, similar to
 * cli-task-integration.test.ts, but may use different mocks or fixtures.
