/**
 * End-to-End Tests for CLI Task System Integration
 *
 * These tests verify the functionality of the `task` command suite
 * by executing the compiled CLI as a child process. They cover
 * task creation, status checking, execution, cancellation, results,
 * listing, filtering, and potentially more advanced workflows like
 * dependencies and chaining.
 *
 * Note: These tests assume the existence of task types like 'simple-task'
 * and 'error-task' registered within the application for testing purposes.
