# SwissKnife Phase 5 Tests

This directory contains the test suite for Phase 5 components of the SwissKnife project, focusing on performance optimization, release preparation, testing tools, documentation generation, and UX enhancement.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests

Located in `/test/unit/`, these tests verify individual component functionality:

- `performance/optimizer.test.ts`: Tests for the PerformanceOptimizer class
- `release/packager.test.ts`: Tests for the ReleasePackager class
- `testing/test-runner.test.ts`: Tests for the TestRunner class
- `documentation/doc-generator.test.ts`: Tests for the DocumentationGenerator class
- `ux/cli-ux-enhancer.test.ts`: Tests for the CLIUXEnhancer class
- `cli/performanceCommand.test.ts`: Tests for the CLI performance command
- `cli/releaseCommand.test.ts`: Tests for the CLI release command

### Integration Tests

Located in `/test/integration/`, these tests verify interactions between components:

- `phase5.test.ts`: Tests how the Phase 5 components work together in various workflows

### Benchmark Tests

Located in `/test/benchmark/`, these tests measure performance:

- `phase5.benchmark.ts`: Performance benchmarks for Phase 5 components

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

### Benchmark Tests

```bash
pnpm test:benchmark
```

### All Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Test Coverage

To generate test coverage reports:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Test Guidelines

1. **Isolation**: Each unit test should focus on a single piece of functionality.
2. **Mock Dependencies**: Use Jest mocks to isolate components from their dependencies.
3. **Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage across all components.
4. **Benchmarking**: All performance-critical code should have benchmark tests with specific time thresholds.
5. **Readability**: Use descriptive test names and organize tests logically.

## Test Extension

When adding new functionality to Phase 5 components:

1. Create corresponding unit tests in the appropriate directory
2. Update integration tests to cover new component interactions
3. Add performance benchmarks for critical operations
4. Update this README if necessary

## Performance Thresholds

The benchmark tests define acceptable performance thresholds:

- PerformanceOptimizer: < 1000ms
- ReleasePackager: < 1000ms
- TestRunner: < 1000ms
- DocumentationGenerator: < 500ms
- Full Release Process: < 2000ms

These thresholds should be adjusted based on actual performance measurements in the target environment.
