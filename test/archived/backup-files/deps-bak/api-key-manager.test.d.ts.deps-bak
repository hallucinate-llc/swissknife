/**
 * Unit Tests for the ApiKeyManager class (`src/auth/api-key-manager.js`).
 *
 * These tests verify the manager's ability to add, retrieve, remove, and list API keys,
 * handle environment variable integration, manage key rotation/invalidation (if implemented),
 * interact with encryption utilities, and persist keys via the ConfigurationManager.
 *
 * Dependencies (ConfigurationManager, encryption utils) are mocked.
