/**
 * Unit Tests for the Agent class (`src/ai/agent/agent.js`).
 *
 * These tests verify the Agent's core logic, including initialization,
 * tool registration, and the message processing flow, focusing on
 * interactions with its direct dependencies (ToolExecutor, ThinkingManager, Model).
 * Dependencies are mocked to isolate the Agent's behavior.
