/**
 * System Integration Test for MCP Server Functionality.
 *
 * This test verifies the end-to-end flow:
 * 1. Starting the MCP server via the CLI entrypoint (`cli.mjs mcp serve`).
 * 2. Connecting a real MCP SDK Client to the running server process using StdioTransport.
 * 3. Listing tools exposed by the server.
 * 4. Calling specific tools (e.g., glob, fileRead) and verifying their output.
 *
 * It uses a temporary directory and file for testing file-based tools.
