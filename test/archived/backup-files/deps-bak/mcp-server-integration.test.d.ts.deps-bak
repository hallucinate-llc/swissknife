/**
 * Integration Tests for the MCP Server Entrypoint (`src/entrypoints/mcp.ts`)
 *
 * These tests verify that the MCP server process can be started and potentially
 * that it initializes correctly. It does *not* test client-server communication
 * in detail, focusing only on the server process lifecycle.
 *
 * NOTE: This test spawns a real Node.js process. Ensure the entrypoint path is correct.
 * It relies on the server emitting specific output to stdout to confirm startup.
